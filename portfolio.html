									<h2 style="color: whitesmoke">Inventory Tracker</h2>
									<p>I was inspired to build an inventory tracker after seeing a mobile robot scan and surveil pantry 
										items in Costco. Therefore, I decided to make a basic application in which users can add and remove 
										items from a list. I also allowed them to include quantities of each individual item on the list. 
										I was able to get a lot of experience with Node.js, React.js, and web design as I mostly worked with
										backend programming languages. The hardest parts were incorporating buttons and other components that
										the user interacts with, especially when the user gives unusual commands. For example, when a user adds 
										the same item twice, I needed to ensure that the initial item's quantity increases rather than adding the 
										same item again. 

										To improve the app, I am planning to add a feature that allows translation to different languages.

									<h2 style="color: whitesmoke">Blockchain Project</h2>
									<p>I recently completed my research position as a Blockchain Undergraduate Assistant. Due to my recent fascination with
										blockchain and cryptocurrencies, I decided to try implementing a <a href="https://github.com/gan0412/Blockchain2"> basic blockchain application 
										</a> with Python and Flask to understand how exactly blockchain works. I did use many tutorials and genAI tools to implement 
										features and methods. In the end, I was able to make a basic web application that is deployable on a local server and can perform 
										all of the basic features of blockchain (consensus algorithms, proof-of-work, hashing) through simple user interaction. I also 
										gained some new habits along the way, like developing modular code and writing docstrings. 

										Fun fact: I presented my application to two employers at a data analytics company, and they provided feedback that I 
										incorporated accordingly. Based on the feedback, I mainly formatted my documentation and organized my code into multiple files 
										- frontend, backend, server, etc.

									<h2 style="color: whitesmoke">Masterchef Machine Learning Project</h2>
									<p>After taking a course on machine learning, I was eager to start applying my skills. Since I was a very avid addict to cooking shows,
										I decided to apply what I have learnt to Masterchef, a reality TV show I regularly watch. I wanted to predict the probability of previous 
										contestants making the show for the current season, so I used logistic regression and gradient descent to construct my prediction model.
										I used the ranks and previous seasons of contestants as features for my model, and I generated at least 1000 synthetic data points as training
										data. I would not call it the most accurate model but I learned a lot and had great fun with it. I have my model posted on my 
										<a href="https://github.com/gan0412/Masterchef_ML_Project"> Github </a> for reference.
